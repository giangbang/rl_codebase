# rl_codebase
Simple codebase for my RL projects. 
This repo is aimed to be simple, lightweight with minimal amound of code, which serves as a starting point for reproducing RL algorithms. 
Each of the file in the repo is loosely coupled with each other for code reusability.
Some part of the code is adapted from [Stable-Baselines3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3).
